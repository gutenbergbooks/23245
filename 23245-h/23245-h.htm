<h2>TORU DUTT.</h2>

<h3>INTRODUCTORY MEMOIR.</h3>


<p>If Toru Dutt were alive, she would still be
younger than any recognized European writer,
and yet her fame, which is already considerable,
has been entirely posthumous. Within
the brief space of four years which now
divides us from the date of her decease, her
genius has been revealed to the world under
many phases, and has been recognized
throughout France and England. Her name,
at least, is no longer unfamiliar in the ear
of any well-read man or woman. But at
the hour of her death she had published but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
one book, and that book had found but two
reviewers in Europe. One of these, M.
Andr&eacute; Theuriet, the well-known poet and
novelist, gave the "Sheaf gleaned in French
Fields" adequate praise in the "Revue
des Deux Mondes;" but the other, the
writer of the present notice, has a melancholy
satisfaction in having been a little
earlier still in sounding the only note of
welcome which reached the dying poetess
from England. It was while Professor W.
Minto was editor of the "Examiner,"
that one day in August, 1876, in the very
heart of the dead season for books, I happened
to be in the office of that newspaper,
and was upbraiding the whole body of
publishers for issuing no books worth reviewing.
At that moment the postman brought
in a thin and sallow packet with a wonderful
Indian postmark on it, and containing a most
unattractive orange pamphlet of verse, printed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
at Bhowanipore, and entitled "A Sheaf
gleaned in French Fields, by Toru Dutt."
This shabby little book of some two hundred
pages, without preface or introduction, seemed
specially destined by its particular providence
to find its way hastily into the waste-paper
basket. I remember that Mr. Minto thrust it
into my unwilling hands, and said "There!
see whether you can't make something of
that." A hopeless volume it seemed, with its
queer type, published at Bhowanipore, printed
at the Saptahiksambad Press! But when at
last I took it out of my pocket, what was my
surprise and almost rapture to open at such
verse as this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still barred thy doors! The far east glows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The morning wind blows fresh and free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should not the hour that wakes the rose<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Awaken also thee?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All look for thee, Love, Light, and Song,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Light in the sky deep red above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Song, in the lark of pinions strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And in my heart, true Love.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Apart we miss our nature's goal,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why strive to cheat our destinies?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was not my love made for thy soul?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy beauty for mine eyes?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">No longer sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Oh, listen now!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">I wait and weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">But where art thou?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>When poetry is as good as this it does not
much matter whether Rouveyre prints it upon
Whatman paper, or whether it steals to light
in blurred type from some press in Bhowanipore.</p>

<p>Toru Dutt was the youngest of the three
children of a high-caste Hindu couple in
Bengal. Her father, who survives them all,
the Baboo Govin Chunder Dutt, is himself
distinguished among his countrymen for the
width of his views and the vigour of his intelligence.
His only son, Abju, died in 1865, at
the age of fourteen, and left his two younger
sisters to console their parents. Aru, the
elder daughter, born in 1854, was eighteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
months senior to Toru, the subject of this
memoir, who was born in Calcutta on the
4th of March, 1856. With the exception of
one year's visit to Bombay, the childhood of
these girls was spent in Calcutta, at their
father's garden-house. In a poem now printed
for the first time, Toru refers to the scene of
her earliest memories, the circling wilderness
of foliage, the shining tank with the round
leaves of the lilies, the murmuring dusk under
the vast branches of the central casuarina-tree.
Here, in a mystical retirement more
irksome to an European in fancy than to an
Oriental in reality, the brain of this wonderful
child was moulded. She was pure Hindu,
full of the typical qualities of her race and
blood, and, as the present volume shows us
for the first time, preserving to the last her
appreciation of the poetic side of her ancient
religion, though faith itself in Vishnu and
Siva had been cast aside with childish things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
and been replaced by a purer faith. Her
mother fed her imagination with the old
songs and legends of their people, stories
which it was the last labour of her life to
weave into English verse; but it would seem
that the marvellous faculties of Toru's mind
still slumbered, when, in her thirteenth year,
her father decided to take his daughters to
Europe to learn English and French. To
the end of her days Toru was a better
French than English scholar. She loved
France best, she knew its literature best, she
wrote its language with more perfect elegance.
The Dutts arrived in Europe at the close of
1869, and the girls went to school, for the first
and last time, at a French pension. They
did not remain there very many months;
their father took them to Italy and England
with him, and finally they attended for a short
time, but with great zeal and application, the
lectures for women at Cambridge. In November,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
1873, they went back again to Bengal,
and the four remaining years of Toru's life
were spent in the old garden-house at Calcutta,
in a feverish dream of intellectual effort
and imaginative production. When we consider
what she achieved in these forty-five
months of seclusion, it is impossible to
wonder that the frail and hectic body succumbed
under so excessive a strain.</p>

<p>She brought with her from Europe a store
of knowledge that would have sufficed to make
an English or French girl seem learned, but
which in her case was simply miraculous.
Immediately on her return she began to study
Sanskrit with the same intense application
which she gave to all her work, and mastering
the language with extraordinary swiftness,
she plunged into its mysterious literature.
But she was born to write, and despairing of
an audience in her own language, she began
to adopt ours as a medium for her thought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
Her first essay, published when she was
eighteen, was a monograph, in the "Bengal
Magazine," on Leconte de Lisle, a writer with
whom she had a sympathy which is very easy
to comprehend. The austere poet of "La Mort
de Valmiki" was, obviously, a figure to whom
the poet of "Sindhu" must needs be attracted
on approaching European literature. This
study, which was illustrated by translations
into English verse, was followed by another
on Jos&eacute;phin Soulary, in whom she saw more
than her maturer judgment might have justified.
There is something very interesting and
now, alas! still more pathetic in these sturdy
and workmanlike essays in unaided criticism.
Still more solitary her work became, in July,
1874, when her only sister, Aru, died, at the
age of twenty. She seems to have been no less
amiable than her sister, and if gifted with less
originality and a less forcible ambition, to
have been finely accomplished. Both sisters<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
were well-trained musicians, with full contralto
voices, and Aru had a faculty for design
which promised well. The romance of "Mlle.
D'Arvers" was originally projected for Aru to
illustrate, but no page of this book did Aru
ever see.</p>

<p>In 1876, as we have said, appeared that
obscure first volume at Bhowanipore. The
"Sheaf gleaned in French Fields" is certainly
the most imperfect of Toru's writings, but it
is not the least interesting. It is a wonderful
mixture of strength and weakness, of genius
overriding great obstacles and of talent succumbing
to ignorance and inexperience. That
it should have been performed at all is so
extraordinary that we forget to be surprised
at its inequality. The English verse is sometimes
exquisite; at other times the rules of
our prosody are absolutely ignored, and it is
obvious that the Hindu poetess was chanting
to herself a music that is discord in an English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
ear. The notes are no less curious, and to a
stranger no less bewildering. Nothing could
be more na&iuml;ve than the writer's ignorance at
some points, or more startling than her learning
at others. On the whole, the attainment
of the book was simply astounding. It consisted
of a selection of translations from nearly
one hundred French poets, chosen by the
poetess herself on a principle of her own
which gradually dawned upon the careful
reader. She eschewed the Classicist writers
as though they had never existed. For her
Andr&eacute; Chenier was the next name in chronological
order after Du Bartas. Occasionally
she showed a profundity of research that
would have done no discredit to Mr. Saintsbury
or "le doux Assellineau." She was
ready to pronounce an opinion on Napol le
Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;an or to detect a plagiarism in Baudelaire.
But she thought that Alexander Smith
was still alive, and she was curiously vague<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
about the career of Saint Beuve. This inequality
of equipment was a thing inevitable
to her isolation, and hardly worth recording,
except to show how laborious her mind was,
and how quick to make the best of small
resources.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the "Sheaf
gleaned in French Fields" attracted the very
minimum of attention in England. In France
it was talked about a little more. M. Garcin
de Tassy, the famous Orientalist, who scarcely
survived Toru by twelve months, spoke of it
to Mlle. Clarisse Bader, author of a somewhat
remarkable book on the position of women
in ancient Indian society. Almost simultaneously
this volume fell into the hands of
Toru, and she was moved to translate it into
English, for the use of Hindus less instructed
than herself. In January, 1877, she accordingly
wrote to Mlle. Bader requesting her authorization,
and received a prompt and kind reply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
On the 18th of March Toru wrote again to
this, her solitary correspondent in the world
of European literature, and her letter, which
has been preserved, shows that she had already
descended into the valley of the shadow of
death:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Ma constitution n'est pas forte; j'ai contract&eacute; une toux
opini&acirc;tre, il y a plus de deux ans, qui ne me quitte point.
Cependant j'esp&egrave;re mettre la main &agrave; l'&#339;uvre bient&ocirc;t. Je
ne peux dire, mademoiselle, combien votre affection,&mdash;car
vous les aimez, votre livre et votre lettre en t&eacute;moignent
assez,&mdash;pour mes compatriotes et mon pays me touche; et je
suis fi&egrave;re de pouvoir le dire que les h&eacute;roines de nos grandes
&eacute;pop&eacute;es sont dignes de tout honneur et de tout amour. Y a-ti-il
d'h&eacute;roine plus touchante, plus aimable que S&icirc;ta? Je ne
le crois pas. <i>Quand j'entends ma m&egrave;re chanter, le soir,
les vieux chants de notre pays, je pleure presque toujours.</i>
La plainte de S&icirc;ta, quand, bannie pour la s&eacute;conde fois, elle
erre dans la vaste for&ecirc;t, seule, le d&eacute;sespoir et l'effroi dans
l'&acirc;me, est si path&eacute;tique qu'il n'y a personne, je crois, qui
puisse l'entendre sans verser des larmes. Je vous envois
sous ce pli deux petites traductions du Sanscrit, cette belle
langue antique. Malheureusement j'ai &eacute;t&eacute; oblig&eacute;e de faire
cesser mes traductions de Sanscrit, il y a six mois. Ma
sant&eacute; ne me permet pas de les continuer.</p></div>

<p>These simple and pathetic words, in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
the dying poetess pours out her heart to the
one friend she had, and that one gained too
late, seem as touching and as beautiful as any
strain of Marceline Valmore's immortal verse.
In English poetry I do not remember anything
that exactly parallels their resigned melancholy.
Before the month of March was over,
Toru had taken to her bed. Unable to write,
she continued to read, strewing her sick-room
with the latest European books, and entering
with interest into the questions raised by the
Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Asiatique of Paris in its printed Transactions.
On the 30th of July she wrote her
last letter to Mlle. Clarisse Bader, and a month
later, on the 30th of August, 1877, at the age
of twenty-one years, six months, and twenty-six
days, she breathed her last in her father's
house in Maniktollah Street, Calcutta.</p>

<p>In the first distraction of grief it seemed as
though her unequalled promise had been
entirely blighted, and as though she would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
remembered only by her single book. But
as her father examined her papers, one completed
work after another revealed itself.
First a selection from the sonnets of the
Comte de Grammont, translated into English,
turned up, and was printed in a Calcutta
magazine; then some fragments of an English
story, which were printed in another
Calcutta magazine. Much more important,
however, than any of these was a complete
romance, written in French, being the identical
story for which her sister Aru had proposed
to make the illustrations. In the meantime
Toru was no sooner dead than she began
to be famous. In May, 1878, there appeared
a second edition of the "Sheaf gleaned in
French Fields," with a touching sketch of her
death, by her father; and in 1879 was published,
under the editorial care of Mlle.
Clarisse Bader, the romance of "Le Journal
de Mlle. D'Arvers," forming a handsome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
volume of 259 pages. This book, begun, as
it appears, before the family returned from
Europe, and finished nobody knows when, is
an attempt to describe scenes from modern
French society, but it is less interesting as an
experiment of the fancy, than as a revelation
of the mind of a young Hindu woman of
genius. The story is simple, clearly told, and
interesting; the studies of character have
nothing French about them, but they are full
of vigour and originality. The description of
the hero is most characteristically Indian.&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Il est beau en effet. Sa taille est haute, mais quelques-uns
la trouveraient mince, sa chevelure noire est boucl&eacute;e et
tombe jusqu'&agrave; la nuque; ses yeux noirs sont profonds et
bien fendus, le front est noble; la l&egrave;vre sup&eacute;rieure, couverte
par une moustache naissante et noire, est parfaitement
model&eacute;e; son menton a quelque chose de s&eacute;v&egrave;re; son teint
est d'un blanc presque f&eacute;minin, ce qui d&eacute;note sa haute
naissance.</p></div>

<p>In this description we seem to recognize
some Surya or Soma of Hindu mythology,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
and the final touch, meaningless as applied
to an European, reminds us that in India
whiteness of skin has always been a sign of
aristocratic birth, from the days when it
originally distinguished the conquering Aryas
from the indigenous race of the Dasyous.</p>

<p>As a literary composition "Mlle. D'Arvers"
deserves high commendation. It deals with
the ungovernable passion of two brothers
for one placid and beautiful girl, a passion
which leads to fratricide and madness.
That it is a very melancholy and tragical
story is obvious from this brief sketch of its
contents, but it is remarkable for coherence
and self-restraint no less than for vigour of
treatment. Toru Dutt never sinks to melodrama
in the course of her extraordinary tale,
and the wonder is that she is not more often
fantastic and unreal.</p>

<p>But we believe that the original English
poems, which we present to the public for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
the first time to-day, will be ultimately found
to constitute Toru's chief legacy to posterity.
These ballads form the last and most matured
of her writings, and were left so far fragmentary
at her death that the fourth and fifth in
her projected series of nine were not to be
discovered in any form among her papers.
It is probable that she had not even commenced
them. Her father, therefore, to give
a certain continuity to the series, has filled
up these blanks with two stories from the
"Vishnupurana," which originally appeared
respectively in the "Calcutta Review" and
in the "Bengal Magazine." These are interesting,
but a little rude in form, and they
have not the same peculiar value as the
rhymed octo-syllabic ballads. In these
last we see Toru no longer attempting vainly,
though heroically, to compete with European
literature on its own ground, but turning to
the legends of her own race and country for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
inspiration. No modern Oriental has given
us so strange an insight into the conscience
of the Asiatic as is presented in the stories of
"Prehlad" and of "Savitri," or so quaint a
piece of religious fancy as the ballad of
"Jogadhya Uma." The poetess seems in
these verses to be chanting to herself those
songs of her mother's race to which she
always turned with tears of pleasure. They
breathe a Vedic solemnity and simplicity of
temper, and are singularly devoid of that
littleness and frivolity which seem, if we
may judge by a slight experience, to be the
bane of modern India.</p>

<p>As to the merely technical character of
these poems, it may be suggested that in
spite of much in them that is rough and
inchoate, they show that Toru was advancing
in her mastery of English verse. Such a
stanza as this, selected out of many no less
skilful, could hardly be recognized as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
work of one by whom the language was a late
acquirement:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What glorious trees! The sombre saul,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On which the eye delights to rest,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The betel-nut, a pillar tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With feathery branches for a crest,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light-leaved tamarind spreading wide,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The pale faint-scented bitter neem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seemul, gorgeous as a bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With flowers that have the ruby's gleam.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In other passages, of course, the text reads
like a translation from some stirring ballad,
and we feel that it gives but a faint and
discordant echo of the music welling in
Toru's brain. For it must frankly be confessed
that in the brief May-day of her
existence she had not time to master our
language as Blanco White did, or as Chamisso
mastered German. To the end of her days,
fluent and graceful as she was, she was not
entirely conversant with English, especially
with the colloquial turns of modern speech.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
Often a very fine thought is spoiled for
hypercritical ears by the queer turn of expression
which she has innocently given to it.
These faults are found to a much smaller
degree in her miscellaneous poems. Her
sonnets, here printed for the first time, seem
to me to be of great beauty, and her longer
piece entitled "Our Casuarina Tree," needs
no apology for its rich and mellifluous
numbers.</p>

<p>It is difficult to exaggerate when we try to
estimate what we have lost in the premature
death of Toru Dutt. Literature has no
honours which need have been beyond the
grasp of a girl who at the age of twenty-one,
and in languages separated from her own by
so deep a chasm, had produced so much of
lasting worth. And her courage and fortitude
were worthy of her intelligence. Among
"last words" of celebrated people, that which
her father has recorded, "It is only the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
physical pain that makes me cry," is not the
least remarkable, or the least significant of
strong character. It was to a native of our
island, and to one ten years senior to Toru,
to whom it was said, in words more appropriate,
surely, to her than to Oldham,</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thy generous fruits, though gathered ere their prime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still showed a quickness, and maturing time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But mellows what we write to the dull sweets of Rime.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>That mellow sweetness was all that Toru
lacked to perfect her as an English poet, and
of no other Oriental who has ever lived can
the same be said. When the history of the
literature of our country comes to be written,
there is sure to be a page in it dedicated
to this fragile exotic blossom of song.</p>

<span class="i0">"O Mother, Mother, deign to hear,<br /></span>

<h2>THE ROYAL ASCETIC AND THE HIND.</h2>

<h3><i>From the Vishnu Purana. B. II. Chap. XIII.</i></h3>


<div class="cpoem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">Maitreya.</span> Of old thou gav'st a promise to relate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deeds of Bharat, that great hermit-king:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beloved Master, now the occasion suits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I am all attention.<br /></span>
<span class="i2"><span class="smcap">Parasara.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brahman, hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a mind fixed intently on his gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long reigned in Saligram of ancient fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty monarch of the wide, wide world.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chief of the virtuous, never in his life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harmed he, or strove to harm, his fellow-man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or any creature sentient. But he left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His kingdom in the forest-shades to dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And changed his sceptre for a hermit's staff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with ascetic rites, privations rude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And constant prayers, endeavoured to attain<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Perfect dominion on his soul. At morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fuel, and flowers, and fruit, and holy grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gathered for oblations; and he passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In stern devotions all his other hours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the world heedless, and its myriad cares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heedless too of wealth, and love, and fame.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Once on a time, while living thus, he went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bathe where through the wood the river flows:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his ablutions done, he sat him down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the shelving bank to muse and pray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither impelled by thirst a graceful hind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Big with its young, came fearlessly to drink.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sudden, while yet she drank, the lion's roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feared by all creatures, like a thunder-clap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst in that solitude from a thicket nigh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Startled, the hind leapt up, and from her womb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her offspring tumbled in the rushing stream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whelmed by the hissing waves and carried far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the strong current swoln by recent rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tiny thing still struggled for its life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While its poor mother, in her fright and pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell down upon the bank, and breathed her last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up rose the hermit-monarch at the sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of keen anguish; with his pilgrim staff<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He drew the new-born creature from the wave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas panting fast, but life was in it still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, as he saw its luckless mother dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would not leave it in the woods alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with the tenderest pity brought it home.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There, in his leafy hut, he gave it food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And daily nourished it with patient care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until it grew in stature and in strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the forest skirts could venture forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In search of sustenance. At early morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thenceforth it used to leave the hermitage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the shades of evening come again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the little courtyard of the hut<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie down in peace, unless the tigers fierce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prowling about, compelled it to return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earlier at noon. But whether near or far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wandering abroad, or resting in its home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monarch-hermit's heart was with it still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bound by affection's ties; nor could he think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of anything besides this little hind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His nursling. Though a kingdom he had left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And children, and a host of loving friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Almost without a tear, the fount of love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprang out anew within his blighted heart,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To greet this dumb, weak, helpless foster-child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so, whene'er it lingered in the wilds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or at the 'customed hour could not return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His thoughts went with it; "And alas!" he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Who knows, perhaps some lion or some wolf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ravenous tiger with relentless jaws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already hath devoured it,&mdash;timid thing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, how the earth is dinted with its hoofs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And variegated. Surely for my joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was created. When will it come back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rub its budding antlers on my arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In token of its love and deep delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see my face? The shaven stalks of grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kusha and kasha, by its new teeth clipped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remind me of it, as they stand in lines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like pious boys who chant the Samga Veds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shorn by their vows of all their wealth of hair."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus passed the monarch-hermit's time; in joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With smiles upon his lips, whenever near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His little favourite; in bitter grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fear, and trouble, when it wandered far.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he who had abandoned ease and wealth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And friends and dearest ties, and kingly power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found his devotions broken by the love<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He had bestowed upon a little hind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrown in his way by chance. Years glided on....<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Death, who spareth none, approached at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hermit-king to summon him away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hind was at his side, with tearful eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching his last sad moments, like a child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside a father. He too, watched and watched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His favourite through a blinding film of tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could not think of the Beyond at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So keen he felt the parting, such deep grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'erwhelmed him for the creature he had reared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To it devoted was his last, last thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reckless of present and of future both!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Thus far the pious chronicle, writ of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Brahman sage; but we, who happier, live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the holiest dispensation, know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That God is Love, and not to be adored<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a devotion born of stoic pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or with ascetic rites, or penance hard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with a love, in character akin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To His unselfish, all-including love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore little can we sympathize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With what the Brahman sage would fain imply<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
<span class="i0">As the concluding moral of his tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That for the hermit-king it was a sin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To love his nursling. What! a sin to love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sin to pity! Rather should we deem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever Brahmans wise, or monks may hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he had sinned in <i>casting off</i> all love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his retirement to the forest-shades;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that was to abandon duties high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like a recreant soldier, leave the post<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where God had placed him as a sentinel.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This little hind brought strangely on his path,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This love engendered in his withered heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This hindrance to his rituals,&mdash;might these not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have been ordained to teach him? Call him back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ways marked out for him by Love divine?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a mind less self-willed to adore?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not in seclusion, not apart from all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not in a place elected for its peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the heat and bustle of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid sorrow, sickness, suffering and sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must he still labour with a loving soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who strives to enter through the narrow gate.<br /></span>

<h2>THE LEGEND OF DHRUVA.</h2>

<h3><i>Vishnu Purana. Book I. Chapter XI.</i></h3>


<div class="cpoem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sprung from great Brahma, Manu had two sons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heroic and devout, as I have said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pryavrata and Uttanapado,&mdash;names<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Known in legends; and of these the last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Married two wives, Suruchee, his adored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother of a handsome petted boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uttama; and Suneetee, less beloved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother of another son whose name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was Dhruva. Seated on his throne the king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uttanapado, on his knee one day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had placed Uttama; Dhruva, who beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His brother in that place of honour, longed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To clamber up and by his playmate sit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Led on by Love he came, but found, alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scant welcome and encouragement; the king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw fair Suruchee sweep into the hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With stately step,&mdash;aye, every inch a queen,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And dared not smile upon her co-wife's son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Observing him,&mdash;her rival's boy,&mdash;intent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mount ambitious to his father's knee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where sat her own, thus fair Suruchee spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why hast thou, child, formed such a vain design?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why harboured such an aspiration proud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Born from another's womb and not from mine?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh thoughtless! To desire the loftiest place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The throne of thrones, a royal father's lap!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is an honour to the destined given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not within thy reach. What though thou art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Born of the king; those sleek and tender limbs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold of my blood no portion; I am queen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be the equal of mine only son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were in thee vain ambition. Know'st thou not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair prattler, thou art sprung,&mdash;not, not from mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from Suneetee's bowels? Learn thy place."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Repulsed in silence from his father's lap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indignant, furious, at the words that fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his step-mother's lips, poor Dhruva ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his own mother's chambers, where he stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside her with his pale, thin, trembling lips,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
<span class="i0">(Trembling with an emotion ill-suppressed)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hair in wild disorder, till she took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raised him to her lap, and gently said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh, child, what means this? What can be the cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this great anger? Who hath given thee pain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He that hath vexed thee, hath despised thy sire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in these veins thou hast the royal blood."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus conjured, Dhruva, with a swelling heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repeated to his mother every word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That proud Suruchee spake, from first to last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even in the very presence of the king.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His speech oft broken by his tears and sobs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helpless Suneetee, languid-eyed from care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard sighing deeply, and then soft replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh son, to lowly fortune thou wert born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what my co-wife said to thee is truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No enemy to Heaven's favoured ones may say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such words as thy step-mother said to thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, son, it is not meet that thou shouldst grieve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or vex thy soul. The deeds that thou hast done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The evil, haply, in some former life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long, long ago, who may alas! annul,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or who the good works not done, supplement!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sins of previous lives must bear their fruit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ivory throne, the umbrella of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The best steed, and the royal elephant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich caparisoned, must be his by right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who has deserved them by his virtuous acts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In times long past. Oh think on this, my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be content. For glorious actions done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not in this life, but in some previous birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suruchee by the monarch is beloved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Women, unfortunate like myself, who bear<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As down upon the ground he fell,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then in a grassy open space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sits and leans against a tree,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And heeded not his neighbourhood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some young ones with large eyes and sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came close, and rubbed their foreheads smooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against his arms, and licked his feet,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With this resolve, he soon began<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A statue next of earth he made,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That we were strangers; one, in pain,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then asked,&mdash;Were we from France?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We talked awhile,&mdash;some roses red<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That seemed as wet with tears,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">To deck our Indian bowers.<br /></span>

<h2>THE TREE OF LIFE.</h2>


<div class="cpoem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Broad daylight, with a sense of weariness!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine eyes were closed, but I was not asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My hand was in my father's, and I felt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His presence near me. Thus we often past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silence, hour by hour. What was the need<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of interchanging words when every thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in our hearts arose, was known to each,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every pulse kept time? Suddenly there shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A strange light, and the scene as sudden changed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was awake:&mdash;It was an open plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Illimitable,&mdash;stretching, stretching&mdash;oh, so far!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er it that strange light,&mdash;a glorious light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like that the stars shed over fields of snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a clear, cloudless, frosty winter night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only intenser in its brilliance calm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the midst of that vast plain, I saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I was wide awake,&mdash;it was no dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tree with spreading branches and with leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of divers kinds,&mdash;dead silver and live gold,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Shimmering in radiance that no words may tell!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the tree an Angel stood; he plucked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A few small sprays, and bound them round my head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, the delicious touch of those strange leaves!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer throbbed my brows, no more I felt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fever in my limbs&mdash;"And oh," I cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Bind too my father's forehead with these leaves."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One leaf the Angel took and therewith touched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His forehead, and then gently whispered "Nay!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never, oh never had I seen a face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More beautiful than that Angel's, or more full<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of holy pity and of love divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wondering I looked awhile,&mdash;then, all at once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opened my tear-dimmed eyes&mdash;When lo! the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was gone&mdash;the light as of the stars when snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies deep upon the ground. No more, no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was seen the Angel's face. I only found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father watching patient by my bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And holding in his own, close-prest, my hand.<br /></span>
